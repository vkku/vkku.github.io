## Meeting the Prerequisites
Me and my friend embarked on our incomplete mission to Nag Tibba summit to take a look at pristine peaks and sun rising from behind. The main motivation was to mark it complete little did we knew that we'd get breathtaking views of surrounding peaks, clear skies to gaze stars and most wonderful evening with best time to observe winterline.

We started on from Ghaziabad from train till Dehradun, met a sweet uncle on train who wanted us to be seated next to each other just because we were travelling together(little did he knew we both liked aisle). We packed up on a lot of snacks, only to devour them in the first hour of travel.

Reached DDN at 2200 hrs and rented bike from there. Arranged bungee tethers in almost gone condition.

Same guy who rented us the bike, ran a restro(Uska Punjabi Dhaba) and a hotel(Milan Palace) arranging stay was easy. We stayed in Hotel Abhinandan Grand, next to it. This is a separate story anyway.

## Liftoff
Ended that night with unfathomable thoughts about universe, creation, devotion, evolution among others with my buddy for next 3 days. That was an interesting conversation that kept us awake for long.
Got up early next morning and went for tea, freshed up and started to Pantwari village(Trailhead to Nag Tibba).

Had to cover 90Kms today in order to reach Pantwari, added few kilometers for scenic views. Stopped by at a scenic bridge to pay visit and pay regards to an awesome unnamed rivulet flowing down, meeting Yamuna.

This awesome iron bridge was the one we crossed last time, but was defunct now.

Carried on till we met with unswirling roads through the valleys, seldom passing locals and then the last stretch was the most beautiful. Suddenlt cold turned air pressing on un-visored cheeks, deep valley views with some homes dotting the landscape and meadows some other times. Long rows of trees and fodder stored on them. Long stretches of such roads and then hamlets where people are enjoying the sunny day on benches, shops, small markets. Postcard worthy scenes, that was the area ~5KMs to Pantwari and since this was a weekday we seldom crossed any other vehicle. 2-3 vehicles in full stretch to be precise. There was alternation of shadow and sunny roads going as our goal peak goes, serpentine. This was one of the best trip moments I can name in retrospect.

Reached Pantwari by 1330 hrs only to stop by at a natural water stream, fill out our bottles and a refreshing herb infused face wash which brand down the chills to the core of face muscles.

Had a hearty Rajma-Chawal meal, parked bike and bought some snacks, sticks before embarking on the trek.
